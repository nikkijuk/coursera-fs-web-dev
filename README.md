# coursera-fs-web-dev
Repository for Coursera Full Stack Web Developer Course

## Motivation

There's exciting movement of using web as platform and javascript as implementation language for end-to-end, or full stack, application development - for experienced java developer this is clearly a call for some rethinking.

### Principles

* Programming style: Functional?
* Programming model: Reactive?
* Architecture: SPA? MV..? 
* Layouts: Responsive?

## Technologies

* Javascript 'dialect': ES5? ES6? TypeScript? ..?
* CSS 'dialect' : CSS3? LESS? SASS?
* Frameworks: AngularJs? React? Elm?
* Libraries: Cycle.js
* Mobile: Cordova? Ionic? React Native? Html5?

## Plan

I've decided to go formalize my learning effort around MOOC course, and found one from [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack)

Course alone wouldn't be enought, so I'd decided to harvest some resources which get me forward. I prefer having some books in addtion to online references.
