# fullstack-web-developer-transformation

This is repository Full Stack Web Developer transformation project of mine - and yes, thats enterprisey talk, and means I'm trying to learn a new skill. 

## Motivation

I've seen last years exciting movement of using web as platform and javascript as implementation language for end-to-end, or full stack, application development - for experienced java developer this is clearly a call for some rethinking.

Some other trends I'm feeling important are
- Microservices and self contained systems
- Domain Driven Design
- Functional programming
- Reactive programming
- Event Stream Processing & Big Data
- Single page applications
- Native & hybrid mobile apps
- Responsive & Reactive UI's
- Cloud Computing & IaaS & PaaS
- Serverless apps & FaaS & Web API's
- Agile & Lean & ATDD & CI & ..

Never mind if I miss some - there's lot of things which drive JS as language and JSON and REST as integration technologies forward and enable small and coherent systems to be implemented fast & effective.

### Target & Principles

While learning I need to define guiding principles behind technological choices, which allows me to concentrate to essence.

* Programming style: Functional
* Programming model: Reactive
* User interface design: Responsive
* User interface architecture: SPA? MV..? 

My current mantra is: Functional Reactive apps, which have responsive layout - but this leaves still lot open.

## Technologies

It's essential question which technologies work together to allow me to develop elegant, easy to maintain and easy to extend web applications.

My current guesses for match are

* Javascript 'dialect': ES6 (with Babel or Traceur) or TypeScript
* CSS 'dialect' : CSS3 with SASS in SCSS format
* Frameworks: Angular? React? Elm? -- still open, depends on development teams history / preferences
* Reactive libraries: RxJs seems de facto standard
* Layouts: Bootsrap with SASS / SCSS format 
* Testing: Jasmine? -- still open
* Mobile: Ionic? NativeScript? React Native? PWA? -- still open, depends on rquirements of project

It is useful to aligh with [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar] (https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar) and let it guide me.

## Execution

I decided to formalize my learning effort around MOOC course, and found one from [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack)

In addition I did go thru needed introductory and intermediate courses from [Sitepoint Premium] (https://www.sitepoint.com)

Course & Video material alone wouldn't be enought, so I've decided to harvest some resources which get me forward. I prefer having some books in addtion to online references.
