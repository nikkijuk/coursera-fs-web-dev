This is repository Full Stack Web Developer transformation project of mine

## Motivation

There's exciting movement of using web as platform and javascript as implementation language for end-to-end, or full stack, application development - for experienced java developer this is clearly a call for some rethinking.

Some other trends to note are 
- Microservices and self contained systems
- Domain Driven Design
- Functional programming
- Reactive programming & UI's
- Event Stream Processing & Big Data
- Single page applications
- Hybrid mobile apps
- Cloud Computing & IaaS & PaaS
- Serverless apps & FaaS & Web API's

Never mind if I miss some - there's lot of things which drive JS as language and JSON and REST as integration technologies forward and enable smaller and coherent systems to be implemented fast & effective.

### Principles

I need to define guiding principles behind technological choices, which allows me to concentrate to essence.

* Programming style: Functional?
* Programming model: Reactive?
* Architecture: SPA? MV..? 
* Layouts: Responsive?

My current mantra is: Functional Reactive apps, which have responsive layout - but this leaves still lot open.

## Technologies

It's essential question which technologies work together to allow me to develop elegant, easy to maintain and easy to extend web applications.

* Javascript 'dialect': ES5? ES6? TypeScript? ..?
* CSS 'dialect' : CSS3? LESS? SASS?
* Frameworks: AngularJs? React? Elm?
* Reactive libraries: Cycle.js? RxJs? Reactive.js? Bacon.js?
* Layouts: Bootsrap?
* Mobile: Cordova? Ionic? React Native? Html5?

It's just not applicable to try all of these, so I'll let [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar] (https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar) to guide me.

## Plan

I've decided to formalize my learning effort around MOOC course, and found one from [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack)

Course alone wouldn't be enought, so I've decided to harvest some resources which get me forward. I prefer having some books in addtion to online references.
